<p>Here are some professionals that I’ve worked with closely in reverse chronological order. I hope to give them a brief <em>characiture</em>, as they’re more than names that appear beside mine in a publication.</p>

<p><a href="https://priyan.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Priyan Vaithilingam</a> - A window for me into the world of human-computer interactions. Priyan is goal-direct in doing research, yet at the same time he is extremely open-minded. He moves extremely quickly to capture current trends of AI and applying them in usability research. Co-advised with <a href="https://glassmanlab.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elena Glassman</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://rxdhawkins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Hawkins</a> - A kindred spirit working on the same problem of communicative aspects of programming and AI. My goto for questions regarding communication+cogsci and statistics, as he would just <em>know stuffs</em> about them. Working with him to design a comprehensive human experiment in knowledge transmission has been an invaluable experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://iamleo.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo Hernández Cano</a> - The biggest challenge in working with Leo is keeping each other in check from trying all the cool ideas. Leo strives for elegance in a solution,and is stubborn (in a good way) how the project should be. He’s brave in just trying out something fun to see what’ll happen and iterates quickly. Co-advised with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Armando Solar-Lezama</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://saujasv.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saujas Vaduguru</a> - Saujas found me in a virtual presentation and we have been pushing the boundaries of pragmatics + program synthesis ever since. Makes the clearest presentations and super well read in the literatures. Draws connections between different ideas together and someone I enjoy being philosophical with. Co-advised with <a href="https://dpfried.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Fried</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.karlddwillis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karl D.D. Willis</a> - My manager at Autodesk research. He sees values in my research and works with me to propagate them to the rest of the research team and the company. Provides a conduit for my work into the world of CADs. Karl is an adventurer and it’s always fun to hear his stories.</p>

<p><a href="https://samacquaviva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Acquaviva</a> - Collaborator on the <a href="https://github.com/samacqua/LARC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LARC</a> project. Sam showed incredible patience and positivity with both my advising and the project despite both of our inexperience with the project. Sam has a knack for making the right design choices in working with human participants, and has a great sense of a e s t h e t i c c s. Co-advised with <a href="http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Tenenbaum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mud.cgl.uwaterloo.ca/mkryven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marta Kryven</a> - Practically taught me how to do human experiments professionally: experiment design, user tutorial, data collection, and how to give a professional stats person a well-formatted csv so they can run R on it. RIP Julio, should’ve gave it to me – giving it to Kevin was not the way.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh Tenenbaum</a> - I learned how to become a better scientist from Josh just by osmosis. He showed me to have a good brand you need to relentlessly iterate on it, hone it, and explain it so it becomes second nature. A meaningful half-an-hour chat with Josh translates to a meaningful half-a-year of works. I know he takes an extra effort to meet with me in his busy schedule, and I am grateful.</p>

<p><a href="https://maxwellnye.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxwell Nye</a> - Made me realize it is important to network in research and having a good institutional awareness on who in who’s group does what. Advised me to “try a simpler idea on a bigger scale”. Introduced me to this cool thing called “pragmatics”. Hard countered by fries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Ellis</a> - Kevin will state at 8pm that he is “calling it a day”, only to go home and write so much code by whispering to his computer, and run 3 miles the next morning before you see him again at 11am. Taught me to first write down what plots we wanted in the paper and working backwards. Saved me more than once in pushing bayesian equations around. Gym buddy and swole bro.</p>

<p><a href="https://obastani.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Osbert Bastani</a> - Osbert was explaining his research at one point, and a combative audience started asking unproductive, ill-posed questions. Osbert looked at him with genuine confusion “sorry I don’t understand, what do you mean by that?”. The audience started to clarify his own question, and within 10 seconds it was game over for him.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zmiranda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zachery Miranda</a> - First student I mentored. Despite my inexperience Zach was such a good natured and competent person it worked out well. Best Taliyah mid NA, especially in combo with my Rammus gank.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zenna.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zenna Tavares</a> - Introduced me to the computational cogsci universe. Owner of the follow up question “in what sense?” after you making any statement. Elevated my thinking and cooking by showing me convincing alternatives such as being bayesian and using a blender. A supportive friend in my trying times.</p>

<p><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leslie Pack Kaelbling</a> - PhD co-advisor. Forced me to whittle my effusive research ideas down to a single math expression. Taught me one cannot begin to solve something without formalizing the question first. Her dry skepticism saved me from the ML kool-aid. The strict yet supportive coach in my corner.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Karthik Narasimhan</a> - Mentor who introduced me to the world of machine learning on a professional level. In a hands on way showed me how to prioritize and operationalize a ML project.</p>

<p><a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Armando Solar-Lezama</a> - The best PhD advisor I could’ve asked for. Patient, so patient, encouraging to a fault, even in my 4 years with 0 publications. He gave me a safe, calm environment to find my own voice in research. My role model in finding fulfillment in both research, personal relationships, and family. Showed me to make octopus tender you first beat the crap out of it with a skillet, then cook for at least 40 minutes hasta k este bien suave.</p>

<p><a href="https://koksal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ali Sinan Köksal</a> - Made me realize that to convince someone of an idea, you needed at least one, concrete point of irrefutable evidence. Showed me one shouldn’t judge music by its genre, and that party-rock anthem is a great song. Encouraged me to start the twitch stream and develop an online presence.</p>

<p><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bodik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ras Bodik</a> - Gave undergrad me a chance at his lab, introduced me to the professional world of research. Nurtured me and held my hand in a manner above and beyond his obligations. Most fashionable professor you’d come across. 我人生中的贵人 (no idea how to translate this).</p>
