# Natural Programming Lab

(still under construction, but here's a preview of my lab!)

Human communication is remarkable in that it is simultaneously flexible and precise: Flexible in the sense that people can successfully communicate across different modalities, situations, and conversation partners; Precise in a way that people can collaborate to design intricate machines, perform surgeries, and fly to the moon. What are the underlying mechanisms behind this remarkable feat of human communication, and how can we leverage these mechanisms to build intuitive interactive systems? That's the focus of my lab.

## lab mission

[This PDF](/assets/lab_mission_5yrs.pdf) outlines the short term mission of my lab, with emphasis on Dataset Curation, Cognitive Modeling, and System Building.
