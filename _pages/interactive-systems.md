# Interactive Systems !

Here are some interactive systems with web interfaces that you can interact with. 
These systems fall under my broad research area of "Pragmatic Program Synthesis", which [this video](https://youtu.be/vLEEZay_JzY?si=vaEn-YkAsZH5rcrZ) is a light introduction, give it a watch!

From [Program Synthesis with Pragmatic Communication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05060.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Communicate target pattern to the robots by showing it informative examples. Play with the system [here](https://evanthebouncy.github.io/program_synthesis_pragmatics/interactive_mode/)

From [Generating Pragmatic Examples to Train Neural Program Synthesizers
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05740.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Use positive and negative examples to communicate a regular expression to a neuro-symbolic program synthesizer. Play with the system [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pragmatic-programs/pragmatic-synthesizer)
