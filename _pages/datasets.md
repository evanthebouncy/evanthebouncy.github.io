# Datasets !

Here are some Datasets that I played a major role in curating. [This Video](https://youtu.be/4_hk_qJ8tWk?si=dtuIyXXvWwM7ZvDh) is a good summary of how I think about dataset curation and how to do it.

### mmmCAD : Multi-modal Modification of CAD
<img src="/assets/images/datasets/mmmCAD.png" alt="Project Image" width="70%" />

Small scale data from [Communicating Design Intent Using Drawing and Text](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3635636.3664261){:target="_blank"}. \[~100 man-hours\] One participant (Designer) communicate with another (Maker) to collaboratively re-create a precise 2D CAD design. The Designer is given a target design, and must use drawing and language to communicate to the maker, who makes the design using a CAD interface. 


Large scale data from [mrCAD: Multimodal Refinement of Computer-aided Designs](https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/mrCAD) A scaled up version of multi-modal communication about design refinements. mrCAD consists of 6,082 communication games, 15,163 instruction-execution rounds, played between 1,092 pairs of human players. \[~2000 man-hours\]

### LARC : Language-complete Abstract Reasoning Corpus
<img src="/assets/images/datasets/larc.jpeg" alt="Project Image" width="70%" />

From [Communicating Natural Programs to Humans and Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07824){:target="_blank"}. \[~350 man-hours\] One participant (Describer) describes an abstract transformation of grids from the [ARC corpus](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC) to another (Builder) using language. The builder applies the transformation on a new input grid to produce an output grid. Access the dataset [here](https://github.com/samacqua/LARC).

### DARC: A Recursive Decomposition Dataset of ARC Tasks

<img src="/assets/images/datasets/darc.png" alt="Project Image" width="70%" />

From [ANPL: Towards Natural Programming with Interactive Decomposition
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18498){:target="_blank"}. \[~440 man-hours\] A corpus of 227 ARC tasks, recursively decomposed and grounded as Python code. Access the dataset [here](https://iprc-dip.github.io/ANPL/)

### DiffVL100 

<img src="/assets/images/datasets/diffVL.png" alt="Project Image" width="70%" />

From [DiffVL: Scaling Up Soft Body Manipulation using Vision-Language Driven Differentiable Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06408){:target="_blank"}. \[~50 man-hours\] 100 soft-body manipulation tasks inspired by real-life scenarios from online videos. Access the dataset [here](https://sites.google.com/view/diffvl/home)
